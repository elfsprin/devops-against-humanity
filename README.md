Work-friendly devops-against-humanity
=======================

DevOps Against Humanity (an expansion for [Cards Against Humanity](http://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com))

### This work is derivative

You can find the original DevOps Against Humanity game [here](https://github.com/bridgetkromhout/devops-against-humanity)

This fork is to provide a "work-friendly" version of the game.

### Card lists

### Generating the PDFs

I used http://biggerblackercards.com/ to generate PDFs for printing. You can find notes on other options in Bridget's README.
